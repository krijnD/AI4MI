    "### Finding the Transformation with Elastix\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the transformation between two image segmentations (the correctly labeled GT and the wrongly transformed GT), I used the **Elastix** tool in **3D Slicer**. Elastix is a versatile registration algorithm that computes the spatial transformation required to align one image (moving image) to another (fixed image).\n",
    "\n",
    "For my task, I performed a **rigid/affine registration** between the correct ground truth (GT2) as the fixed image and the incorrectly transformed ground truth (GT) as the moving image.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Images**: \n",
    "   - The fixed image was the correct segmentation.\n",
    "   - The moving image was the incorrectly transformed segmentation.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Elastix Setup**: \n",
    "   - I used a **rigid/affine transform** preset, which allows for rotation, translation, and scaling to align the images.\n",
    "   - I also used a **custom affine transform** preset\n",
    "   - The registration process computes a transformation matrix that maps the coordinates of the moving image to the fixed image.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output**: \n",
    "   - After running the registration, Elastix generated a transformation matrix that aligns the wrong GT with the correct GT.\n",
    "   - Additionally, I enabled the option to output the **inverse transformation**, which allows us to correct the wrongly transformed segmentation by reversing the applied transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation was saved as a file, which I then used to correct the wrongly transformed segmentation in subsequent analysis steps.\n"
